# 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Image Classification App

A deep learning project to classify images as **Cat** or **Dog** using **ResNet-101 V2** architecture with **Transfer Learning**.  
A simple, interactive **Gradio web app** is built to make predictions on uploaded images!

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Task:** Binary classification (Cat vs Dog)  
- **Model:** ResNet-101 V2 (Pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on Cats vs Dogs dataset)  
- **Frameworks Used:** TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, Gradio  
- **Dataset:** Microsoft Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle  
- **Deployment:** Gradio Web Application

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Upload an image of a cat or dog.
2. The model processes and classifies the image.
3. The output shows whether it's a **Cat** or **Dog** (with a fun emoji!).
